# Get Updated Articles App 

## Overview
This repository contains the source code for an Android application developed in Kotlin using Jetpack Compose. The application fetches and displays a list of the most popular articles from the New York Times API, allowing users to see more details by tapping on any article in the list. This is a master/detail-style application that adheres to the best coding practices of today.

## High Level Design
- **Architecture**: The app uses the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture to ensure separation of concerns and enhance testability.
- **API**: Utilizes the NY Times Most Popular Articles API to fetch articles based on different periods (1, 7, 30 days).

## Software Development Practices/Tools used 
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: The codebase follows OOP principles for modularity and reusability.
- **Code Quality**: Emphasis on clean, maintainable, and performant code using Kotlin.
- **Compose**
- **MVVM**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio Arctic Fox or later
- Kotlin plugin installed in Android Studio

### Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository using:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Replace `sample-key` in the API URL with your NY Times API key in `src/main/java/com/example/nytimes/util/Constants.kt`.
4. Build the project using Android Studio or by running the following command in the terminal:
   ```bash
